# Bank Churn Predictor using Artificial Neural Network
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting customer churn in the banking sector using an artificial neural network (ANN). The project is designed to help banks identify customers likely to leave and implement strategies to retain them.

## Project Description
### Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model for customer churn using an artificial neural network. The model evaluates key factors influencing churn and provides actionable insights to the bank.

### Dataset
#### Source: Kaggle or any other open-source dataset for customer churn in banking.
#### Features: Includes customer demographic, account information, and transaction behavior.
#### Target Variable: Indicates whether a customer has churned (binary classification: 1 for churn, 0 for no churn).
### Key Features of the Project
Data preprocessing to handle missing values, normalize features, and encode categorical data.
Building and training an artificial neural network from scratch.
Evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Visualization of model performance and key insights.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Zain-Rizwan/BankChurnPredictor_ANN.git
